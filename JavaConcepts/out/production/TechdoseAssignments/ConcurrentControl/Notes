Concurrency can be achieved by 3 ways while doing DB transactions in distributed systems.

if it is a single process with multiple threads, synchronized can work to avoid inconsistency.

for distributed systems,

1. using Set Transaction and rollback in case of any exceptions
2.DB locking, use shared lock and Exclusive lock
shared locking can be kept on multiple rows at the same time so that all will be having read only access
Exclusive lock can be kept on only 1 row at a time and have write access.

3.isolation level present
